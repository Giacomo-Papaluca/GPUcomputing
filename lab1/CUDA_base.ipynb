It requires no setup and runs entirely in the **cloud**. In Google Colab you can write, execute, save and share your Jupiter Notebooks. You access powerful computing resources like **TPUs** and **GPUs** all for free through your browser. All major Python libraries like **Tensorflow**, **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **Pandas**, etc. are pre-installed. Google Colab requires no configuration, you only need a **Google Account** and then you are good to go. Your notebooks are stored in your **Google Drive**, or can be loaded from **GitHub**. Colab notebooks can be shared just as you would with Google Docs or Sheets. Simply click the Share button at the top right of any Colab notebook, or follow these Google Drive file sharing instructions.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zfPMRBrqzjjb"},"source":["##Upload/download files\n","\n","\n","Once you open a **Google Colab notebook**, it creates a **virtual machine** instance on a Google Cloud Platform.

You can also mount your google drive: once you click on **MOUNT DRIVE** in the left sidebar, it will insert a code cell into your notebook that you'll need to run to mount your google drive (it will ask for your authorization).
